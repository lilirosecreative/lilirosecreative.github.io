This showcase is designed by both the students and staff as part of the service design unit. This is an important event for not only Murdoch University, but also the students as it allows them to exhibit their skills and projects to local industry, high schools, other students and the general public. I was part of the design team for the showcase in 2020 where we came up with the theme of ‘Futurism’, being hopeful for the future and using our design skills to create and contribute to a better future. </p>

We each voted for our favourite with the winning theme being futurism, the main idea behind it being about haven hope and optimism for the future. </p>

                    <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Research into this idea of futurism began by looking at past futurist movements. As a group, we decided we would take influence from all different movements and aesthetics of futurism to create our own version of futurism. We were then faced with the challenge of how do we visually represent this new version of futurism with out ideas of the future including optimism, peace, sustainability and innovative technology. A visual investigation was conducted to help us fine-tune our idea of futurism.</p>

                <p class="body-text waste-management-brand-and-identity-summary-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Being assigned to the publication team, we had the responsibility to create the publication that would contain the images and descriptions of all the student work that was to be showcased. We first started with a brainstorm, focusing on the various ways we could go about making the publication and the possibilities that it could take. We wanted the publication to not only promote students as creators and be a portfolio, but also to serve as an inspiration for future students. We had the idea of splitting the publication into eight different booklets to allow more focus on each discipline, and that way, visitors to the event could take a booklet from each different section they were interested in. </p>

                    <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body">A visual investigation into publications was conducted to help us find inspiration that gave us a broad sense of what we wanted to design.</p>
                <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body">However issues started to arise with the budget and it was announced that creating a large publication for the event was not possible anymore. Because of this we were back at our investigation stage, brainstorming cheap and effective ways in which we could display student work. We instead started to look at the idea of a large paper pad in which you could rip off pages. This idea reminded us of a calendar and it was then decided that the publication would double as a square calendar that could be hung up as a way for people to look forward towards their future. As there are 12 months in a year, it was confirmed there would be 12 sections, 8 of them being the disciplines. As the layout for the publication had changed again, more images were compiled into a visual investigation to help generate ideas for ways in which we could lay out the calendar.</p>

                     <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">Along with the alternate colour scheme to go with the disciplines, geometric icons were made to represent each discipline. These icons were to be used within the website and the publication.</p>

                <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">For the calendar aspect of the publication, we thought that having the calendar on only the first page of each section would be best, so we would still have lots of room to showcase student work. I decided to work on these calendar spreads as I already had an idea of what they should look like. I created the calendar in a rhombus, zigzag angular shape to match the branding. I felt the calendar needed something in the background to be more visually engaging so I experimented with different geometric shapes and isometric designs. Quotes that related to each discipline were also used on each calendar page. Below are progress shots of how I got to the final calendar spread. </p>

It was also quite informative, which is something that we aimed for at the start, to inform others of what the creative media degrees are about and what they include. The event also ran smoothly with the speeches, performances and films being played. After the showcase, an exhibition was set up in the library for a longer period of time, to allow those, who didn’t go to the showcase, to view the student work. </p>
<p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body">Displaying 52 artworks from 20 different artists, this perfect bound book is 64 pages long and full of images and descriptions of the street art around Perth. The book also contains artist profiles, as well as an introduction, explaining to people why street art is important to the community. Scattered throughout the pages are also social media profiles and QR codes to the artists websites to help generate exposure for them.</p>

This space acts almost as a digital publication as it contains all the student work from the showcase. The online team also created a 3D virtual experience in which people can attend the showcase from home. This virtual experience enables the user to walk around into different rooms and view the student work. This is beneficial as the showcase is only one night, so will allow people to access the student work even after the showcase finished. </p>
