                    <p class="body-text hidden-treasures-the-problem-body">Street art is public art that should be seen as an extension of art outside the art gallery, engaging people from all walks of life. Sometimes confused with graffiti, a form of vandalism which consists of  word-based scratchy tags, street art is a legal practice that is a combination of images and words painted on walls or other surfaces of a building or structure. </p>
<p class="body-text hidden-treasures-the-problem-body"> Perth is quickly becoming Australia’s second best street art city with an abundance of unique street art hidden in laneways, carparks, underpasses, roller doors and on the sides of buildings. It can enliven, enhance and revive places that are cherished, or even places that have been forgotten and neglected.</p>
<p class="body-text hidden-treasures-the-problem-body"> These beautiful artworks located on our streets are often overlooked and not given the same value as art in an gallery would have. The artworks, as well as the artists are ‘hidden’ and not getting the recognition that they deserve. The importance of street art should not be diminished as it can capture the attention of a person walking by, making them become aware of their surroundings or changing the way they think, something that art in a gallery cannot do. People should realise that these murals are artistic treasures that promote dialogue with their hidden meanings.</p>
<p class="body-text hidden-treasures-the-problem-body">I decided to create a guide book on Perth street art and murals created by local Perth artists. It focuses heavily on the underlying meanings of the artworks as well as the artists themselves.

They will benefit as it will bring tourists and locals to the area, generating more business and traffic.

                <p class="body-text waste-management-competitor-analysis-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">I undertook a competitor analysis of three similar publications to identify positive aspects that could be used in my own publication, and other negative aspects to avoid. From these, I found that creating a strong brand that accurately reflected the content inside was important, as well as having a great emphasis on the photographs to emphasise the artists work to draw the viewers eye. </p>

The purpose of this book is to showcase Michelangelo’s work which they have done so with large pictures of his work scattered throughout the book. Michelangelo was a renaissance artist and his paintings and sculptures were often realistic and portrayed images of Christ. The book clearly reflects this as it looks quite classic, utilising a serif font and a simple grid structure of 2 columns. I think however, the book could have been slightly more creative in its approach as it is celebrating the life and work of Michelangelo. The non-existent colour scheme could have been fixed by using colours often seen in renaissance paintings such as reds, greens, blues and yellows. This could have been used within the headings or other geometric elements to match the images and create a sense of unity.</p>

It showcases all the attractions London has using pictures, a rating system and provides lots of context. Although this book is effective as a tourist book, it is not very visually engaging or exciting. There is lots of text, with often many attractions placed on the same page, leaving only a small amount of space or no space at all for images. I think that images should be a emphasised more in a publication like this as tourists would like to see where they are going. I also think that the images used are of not the best quality as some are a bit dark and it is hard to see what is actually in the picture. However, I do like the grid system that the book has used. The book uses a two column grid system in which all the elements are placed. It gives a neat and professional look and I feel that this two column grid is something I could use in my own publication. Although the grid provides a cohesive look and feel, it becomes quite repetitive as it is used on every page of the publication. To change the layouts on each page, I think some elements could be overlapped or the grid could be disregarded, which would also make the pages more interesting and visually engaging.</p>

Lots of images are spread throughout the pages and often they are quite large, drawing the viewers attention. I think that placing lots of emphasis on these photographs is important as it helps to showcase the artists work. I think that the bright pink colour is effective from this identity as bright colours are often seen in street art. The pink doesn’t take away from the images, but instead works with them. Pink is often placed in spread with images containing pink, which helps to create movement and unity throughout the page. The identity also has a set grid with 8 columns to a page. Because there are so many columns, this grid allows for experimentation so each page has been set up differently, but still complies with the 8 columns. This keeps each page interesting and visually engaging while also unifying the book as a whole. I do feel however, the identity is quite professional and could be slightly more creative. Having overlapping elements or using a decorative font may have added this.</p>

                     <p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body-two">It was obvious from these interviews that people were only somewhat slightly aware of the street art around Perth.</p>
<p class="body-text hidden-treasures-empathy-maps-body-two">Of all the people I interviewed, I was surprised to find out that 50% knew that Perth had an abundance of street art, however, no one could name any Perth or even Australian street artists, or even artists who had painted one-off murals.</p>
<p class="body-text hidden-treasures-empathy-maps-body-two">Also, 90% of people I interviewed said that they didn’t take much notice of street art, and only glanced at it when walking past. However the overall response when asked about street art was quite positive, with interviewees saying its unique and colourful and can spread awareness about different things, so there was a wanting to learn about and appreciate the style. Interviewees also stated that having a guide book on Perth street art would be helpful, because “lots of it is hidden in alleyways and side streets which aren’t seen” (interview 4).</p>

                    <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body">After clearly identifying the audience, their goals and objectives, I started to look at the actual design for the book and look at other publications and images for inspiration. I created a visual investigation that reflected the colours, layouts, and typography that I wanted to use in the final publication. I tried to look at images and layouts that were playful and creative while still looking stylish and professional. I wanted the publication to be described as grungy, funky, creative and artsy as street art has a more urban feel compared to other styles of art.</p>

                    <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">Based on the visual investigation I had created, I started to experiment with different design aspects of the book, first looking at typography. I wanted to include a few different typefaces as I wanted to include different fonts for the headings and body to create variation within the book. For the headings and subheadings, I wanted a font that was bold and thick and chose to use the font Poppins. This font has many of variations, such as bold, semi bold, regular etc. I liked the straight edges and simple modern look that it provided as it was easy to read.  </p>
                     <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">Since the book was about street art, I chose a decorative font that reflected this. I felt that the font ‘Walnut’ reflected this urban and grungy feel I want to portray and would contrast well with the neater and simpler fonts used for the body text and the headings. I planned to use this font behind the heading text like the example to the right. </p>

                         <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">While looking at typography, I also experimented with colour. The final colour scheme chosen consisted of greens and blues with the contrasting colour of yellow. These colours created a grungy and funky looking colour scheme that would allow the main content such as the images to stand out. These colours also symbolised uniqueness, creative expression and learning, which is exactly what I wanted the guidebook to portray.</p>

                <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">The initial grids I created for the publication were quite simple and had been inspired from the books from the competitor analysis, as well as some of the layouts I found in the visual investigation. These initial grids consisted of a 2x4, 2x3, 3x3, and 3x4 grid. However, it was found during the development of the final book that these grids weren’t suitable as they did not allow maximum flexibility in the composition. </p>
                 <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">A 7x4 and a 7x3 gird were also created to work in conjunction with the other grids. Although slightly more complex, these new grids allowed me to use the pages to their full potential, displaying lots of content in a neat and oriented way. These grids also allowed for the pages to have a similar look and feel unifying the book as a whole and creating cohesion.</p>

The were many challenges with this part of the project such as collecting the images as I had limited time to do this due to other commitments. Collecting the content for the artist profiles and the mural descriptions was difficult due to the limited information about them online, so the murals I could not find meanings for I did not end up using. Creating the graphics was also difficult as they were very time consuming due to being digital paintings. </p>

                        <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">The images were collected on three different days. The images I took were of high quality, however some murals were hard to get a picture of due to them being covered by plants, or being placed high up on a wall. However I was able to crop most images quite well and remove the background scene so the focus was just on the mural. I did not overly edit these pictures as I wanted them to be a true representation of the mural that was there, and as some had deteriorated quite badly, this was hard to do. I edited the brightness and contrast as well as the vibrance and saturation of the images so that they stood out within the book and captured the viewers attention. While in Photoshop, these images were also changed to 300DPI and CMYK colour mode so that they would be fit for printing. Present on this page are some examples of how I edited the images. </p>
<p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body hidden-treasures-images-body-two">Some images were also edited with dual-tones, using colours from the colour scheme. The dual toned images gave a fun and distinctive feel.</p>

                         <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">The graphics I created for this publication were all hand drawn using a tablet. The first graphics I created were lots of little stars. I felt that these graphics were fitting to reinforce the ‘treasures’ part of the title and to reinforce that street art should be valued like any other piece of art. While experimenting with the stars, I created a diamond and felt that this graphic was appropriate as the main image or logo for the book. For the final publication this image was present on the front cover and also present throughout the book next to some of the artists names. These graphics were also diverse as the different colours from the colour scheme could be applied to them.</p>
                         <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">For the final publication, I also wanted to include some images of artists however this was not possible due to copyright issues. Instead, I came up with the idea of creating digital paintings of these artists and thought that this would match the street art style well. I first created a digital painting of artist Anya Brock who is known for her bright use of colours. I felt that adding the flowers in the background was fitting as Anya often includes flowers in her work, relating to the underlying theme she explores of feminine strength.</p>
                          <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">I also created maps of the locations of the murals. These were all hand drawn on a tablet which created an imperfect and fun feel, but also accurately representing the locations of the murals. Within the final publication, these maps were displayed at the very beginning, and also scattered throughout the book. They were also filled in with a block colour to suit the branding of the rest of the publication.</p>
