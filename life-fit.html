Sometimes, time management can be hard and finding the right work-life balance between the different aspects of your life even more so. I created the concept and visual identity for app ‘Life Fit’ for the purpose of helping university students to keep a healthy balance between the different aspects of their lives. Tracking the inputs of categories such as work, study and socialising, Life Fit provides its users with a visual indicator of where they spend their time was spent so they can manage and dedicate time more effectively. </p>

The market profile, persona and user matrix allowed me to gain a deeper insight into the users demographics, behaviours, likes, dislikes, thoughts and feelings. The user journey map was used to create a scenario of the user coming across and using the app. This helped me to identify possibilities of where the user could hear about the app, why they are using the app, and problems that may occur. </p>

                <p class="body-text waste-management-competitor-analysis-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">I looked at two similar apps found on the app store to gain an idea into how they were tracking time management.

                         <p class="body-text life-fit-competitor-analysis-body">I think the app does a brilliant job at meeting the users needs as it really is able to track all activities and help with time management. Relating to the 7th Heuristic principle, the user is able to customise and personalise the app by adding a new category if an activity doesn’t fit into the pre-made categories. The pie chart gives a visual of where the user spent their time during the day or week and is aesthetically pleasing to look at. Relating to the 8th Heuristic principle, I like the minimalistic design of the app as it prioritises the content and the features of the app. I dislike how many activities the app has that a person can track. This is because the app could become a distraction or even an obsession as they start to track every little activity.</p>
                          <p class="body-text life-fit-competitor-analysis-body">Some design decisions I would like to make with my app based on this competitor analysis, is to keep the number of categories or activities limited so it does not become a distraction. But also allow the user to have the option to create customisable categories so they feel they have control and freedom do to what they want in the app. Also having goals the user could set and the app could suggest personalised goals based on the users data.</p>

                         <p class="body-text life-fit-competitor-analysis-body">I think that this app does a great job of meeting the users needs. The graph and pie chart are very clear and the user is instantly able to see how much time is spent where. Relating to the 3rd Heuristic principle of user control and freedom, exits are clearly labeled and placed at the top of the page so users can exit a page quickly. Relating to the 8th Heuristic principle, I like that the app is quite simple and aesthetic. It doesn’t focus on the colour schemes or the visual customisation of the app itself as this can become a distraction for some users. Relating to the 4th heuristic principle, because the visual design of the app is consistent throughout it aids in the memorability and learnability of the app. I dislike that the app has a subscription users can buy, as I believe these features should come with the free version. </p>
                          <p class="body-text life-fit-competitor-analysis-body">Some design decisions I would like to make based on this competitor analysis is to have a minimalistic design with visual emphasis placed on the graphs, and buttons to help with learnability and memorability.

I used the Kano model to find out about the customer satisfaction rating for the features of my app. I asked users six different questions relating to the features of the app with the results shown below.</p>
                <img src="images/life-fit-kano-model.png" class="img-responsive life-fit-kano-model">
                <p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body-two wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">From this chart, it seems the most attractive feature is the visual charts with 66%. This feature is important as it allows the user to see to see where they are spending their time and what actions they need to take in order to improve or maintain their work life balance. The feature of being able to edit the calendar was evenly split between two different categories – Must be and One-dimensional. As the app is a calendar, it is expected that users will be able to edit it, and will increase satisfaction if fulfilled. Being able to sync the app to an already existing calendar app on a user’s phone was determined to be indifferent with 50%. This result shows that the aspect does not directly result in customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction, but may save the user time from creating a calendar from scratch if they already have one. The timer was also a feature that was evenly split between two different categories – Attractive and indifferent. This feature may appear attractive to some users as they can track activities accurately and while they are completing them. It may be indifferent to other users due to the fact there are other ways to add a time-slot or activity such as editing the calendar.</p>

                                <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Several users had trouble finding the timer and the ‘create activity icon’ due to them being not obvious, small and close together. One user thought that using more than one type of graph may be beneficial, as the pie chart is limiting. Another user thought that the category buttons on the categories page were check boxes and was confused when taken to another page once they clicked the button. Having a homepage, instead of the app opening to the today page when fist opened was another user suggestion. One user was confused when the app started with the onboarding instead of the login screen. They werent sure what to do. </p>

As well as a pie chart that shows percentages, create a bar chart that shows how many hours were spent on each category. To change the buttons on the category page to a drop down menu. To create a homepage or dashboard page that links to the two main goals of the app - creating activities and viewing the analytics. </p>

                         <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Users mostly found that the navigation of the app was quite clear and easy to understand, with only some hesitation. All users found it easy to sign in and create a new password when the old one has been forgotten. All users were easily able to create a new activity, view the pie and bar graphs and navigate back to the homepage. Most users thought that the overall colour scheme of the app looked good, with colours described as calming and relaxing. </p>
                          <p class="sub-headings waste-management-competitor-analysis-one-title wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">THE BAD</p>
                                <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Several users had trouble finding the timer button. This could be due to its position at the top of the page. Relating to aesthetics,  one user thought that more purple colours could be incorporated into the graphics of the app as it didn’t feel very harmonious. Two users had trouble finding more information about their analytics and kept trying to tap on the bar graphs and individual sections of the pie chart. </p>

                </div>
                 <p class="sub-headings waste-management-competitor-analysis-one-title wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
                <p class="body-text waste-management-brainstorm-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">To make the different sections of the graphs clickable so users can access more detailed information about their analytics from the graph, instead of the button at the top right. To put more purple in the graphs and also the onboarding images at the beginning, and more blue and green into the buttons to make the app more unified. To move the timer in the same section as the ‘create new category’ and ‘create new activity’ button as it provides the same sort of function. </p>
