                                    <p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body">I interviewed many people about general pharmaceutical packaging. Questions I asked included:</p>
                <ol> 
                    <li class="empathy-map-questions waste-management-empathy-map-questions">Is the way the packaging of a product looks important to you? Why/why not? </li>
                    <li class="empathy-map-questions waste-management-empathy-map-questions">When you buy a product, do you make sure that the packaging is recyclable?</li>
                    <li class="empathy-map-questions waste-management-empathy-map-questions">Do you think engaging pharmaceutical packing can improve the experience of going to a pharmacy?</li>
                    <li class="empathy-map-questions waste-management-empathy-map-questions">Do you have any suggestions for how to improve pharmaceutical packaging?</li>
                    </ol>
                <p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body-two">Interviewees agreed that pharmaceutical packaging was “a bit boring as it is completely white” (interview 5). However, interviewees believed that pharmaceutical packaging for prescribed medication did not need to be visually engaging.This was because “medication is chosen by function, rather than appearance” (Interview 1) and it is a necessity, so if people need it they will buy it anyway. For over the counter products however, there is more competition between brands so interviewees believed bright colours, large typography and graphics are more important so they can capture the viewers attention.</p>
                    <p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body-two"> I created an empathy map based on the information I had collected.</p>

                        <p class="body-text waste-management-competitor-analysis-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn"> A competitor analysis of similar products was conducted to see what other identities did well and what they could improve on. From these, I found that have an identifiable colour system and graphics in place would be helpful in capturing the viewers eye. </p>

The different shades of purple allow for an easy process in identifying which products have a higher and lower concentration of the ingredient acrylates copolymer. There is one product however that contains a different colour, which is green. I am not sure why they have made this decision as the packaging does not match the rest of the packaging of the products within this identity, so I would change this to match the rest. The graphic also is a quick way to show the viewer how the product will work by cleaning deep within the skins pores.</p>

The green environmental colours as well as the simple graphical components are successful in conveying the fact that these products contain natural oils that will help to clean and heal the skin. The typography also quickly and effectively shows the information to the audience such as what the product is and how to use the product. However the simpleness of the typography creates a quite professional and plain feel. I would change the typography in the logo to a more unique typeface that would stand out on the packaging.</p>

It would not however make me pick the packaging off the shelf as it would just blend in with all the other very clinical looking products that pharmacies. For that reason, this packaging is not effective in being engaging and visually interesting. I would change all aspects of this packaing. I would incorporate more colours and graphic images to try and fill up some of the white space. I would also change the text to be a slightly bigger size, but keep the same font to maintain a level of professionalism.</p>

                                     <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">For the subheadings of different sections on the packaging, I wanted a typeface that was rough and hand drawn looking to suit the graphical components as well as the idea of natural ingredients. I chose the font Adorn Condensed Sans as I felt that the the unevenness of the letter strokes created a natural and organic feel. </p>
                     <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">For the body text, I wanted to use a simple and easy to read typeface that would display well in a small size. I chose the font charter as I thought this serif font created quite an elegant and simple feel. As it is a serif font, It would also create contrast with the subheading font as well as the logo. </p>

                         <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">I started to develop the logo for the brand identity. I tried a few logos that included graphics such as circular shapes, but felt that a word-mark would be more suitable due to being simple. I experimented with different workmarks using uppercase, lowercase, san serif and script letterforms. After coming to a decision, I created the final logo in illustrator. I chose this as the final logo for the brand as it is simple, elegant and modern and would suit a skincare brand. </p>

                        <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">On the packaging, I wanted to somehow showcase the ingredient that was in that particular product. I decided I would do this using different drawings of plants. For the green tea cleanser, I drew images of camellia sinensis leaves, which are the leaves that are used to produce green tea. For the lavender moisturiser I drew pictures of lavender and for the natural rose-hip oil I drew images of rose-hip plants. I thought the hand drawn and rough feel of the drawings would nicely contrast with the logo.</p>
                        <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">There was also important information that I had to show on the packaging such as the products being Australian made, vegan, animal cruelty free and recyclable packaging. I showed this through the use of symbols. These symbols are easy to identify as they are used on many skincare products and effectively and quickly communicate the message to the viewer. I changed the colour of these symbols according to the packaging.</p>

                <p class="body-text waste-management-empathy-maps-body">On the back of the box, I placed the directions.
