                <p class="body-text waste-management-competitor-analysis-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">I undertook a competitor analysis of two similar websites that showcase a photographers work. Within these websites, I was able to identify positive aspects to be used, as well as negative aspects to avoid. From these I found that a clean and sleek design is best to showcase this type of work and that a tagline and call to action are important to draw the user in. </p>

                <p class="body-text fac-competitor-analysis-one-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">This website creates a personal feel. The pale blue and earthy colours as well as the script typography create an inviting feel. I think that this inviting feel would be something that parent would be attracted to. As parents are part of Jon Beck’s target audience, I will aim to create this personal feeling within the website design for Jon Beck. The navigation of this website may be confusing to users who are not tech savvy. There is no homepage button and instead the logo will take the user to the homepage when clicked on. In Jon Becks website, I will ensure that I include a button for the home page.</p>

The design is very clean and sleek and uses lots of images to showcase the photographers work. I would like to use this sleek, modern feel in Jon Beck’s website to attract a distinguished target audience of high flying corporate and fashion clients. This website however lacks a tagline that would draw the viewer into the site. I will make sure to include a tagline and call to action within Job Becks website to draw the user in and establish a focal point. I like how the homepage is set out in rectangular sections and that the images have been given a square shape. It allows for an easy to follow design.</p>

The chosen theme was labelled as ‘distinctive’ which combined visual elements in a unique and interesting way. Blue and gold colours were chosen to create a glamorous feel that would attract high flying corporate and fashion clients. A modern serif was chosen for the typography to help highlight this luxurious feel, a font that is often seen in luxury magazines. </p>

                <div class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">
                <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">After this, development of the design compositions started to occur which combined both the wireframes and visual investigations and took into account the initial research into the audience and competitors. </p>
                <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">The first composition I came up with utilised a wide variety of imagery to showcase the photographers skills. Lighter blue colours for the header and footer. However I felt that this colour did not match the darker blue within the middle image, so decided to change the colour of the header and footer to a darker blue. The tag line was also very small which was changed in the second composition</p>
                <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">This second composition was more in-line with what I was aiming for. The large title placed over the hero image captured the viewers eye however the colours were used sparingly and the black and white pictures made the layout look uninteresting and uninviting. </p>
                <p class="body-text jon-beck-composition-body">I addressed these issue in the third composition, by bringing in more blue hues within the images themselves and changing the header and footer to black so they seemingly blended in with the images. This ensured the imagery linked together and helped to unify the website. These blue colours created a trustworthy feel as well as one of wisdom, which was appropriate for the client due to his knowledge in photographer. It created an inviting feel and contrasted against the gold call to action buttons, letting them stand out. An asymmetrical element of the layered squares was created In the second section to reflect a distinctive and fresh perspective, helping to hold the users interest.</p>

The type of usability test conducted was an in person usability test in which the participant was encouraged to think out loud. Three participants were tested, their ages ranging from 22-52 all residing between the areas of Rockingham and Perth. The key findings from this usability test were that the design was very clear and easy to follow, the navigational links all worked and lead to the right webpages, and no major issues were found.  </p>
