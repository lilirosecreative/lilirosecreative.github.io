Once used as a convict establishment, asylum and museum, the FAC is now a popular music venue, hosting live acts from local, national and international artists. The popularity of the FAC’s concert series has grown immensely in the past few years and with users finding it hard to access event details, I created a microsite to focus on the unique concert events and other experiences the venue has to offer. With a whole new identity, the new microsite conveyed a contemporary feel reinterpreted with the history of the building, providing a unique user experience to a diverse audience. Optimised for different devices, the website made the task of searching for and finding event information easy. </p>

                <p class="body-text acune-personas-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">To first understand what this new site needed to communicate, I needed to understand the goals of the users, and their reasons for using this new website. In quick design sprints with the client and a larger team of designers, we identified target audience as being quite broad, as the FAC has a very varied range of music events. It was narrowed down to millennials and ‘hip’ boomers with an interest in music and attending music events. Market profiles, personas and user journeys were created to for an in-depth look into the target audience and later allowed me to adapt the content and look and feel of the website, to ensure a maximised user experience. </p>

Within these websites, I was able to identify positive aspects to be used, as well as negative aspects to avoid. Some aspects that I would like to include in my own design include keeping the homepage simple and utilising different visual elements to capture the users attention.</p>

                <p class="body-text fac-competitor-analysis-one-body">This website places a large focus on the artist, instead of the visuals. Although the content is important, visuals are also important as they help draw the user into the website. This website uses lots of white space and relies on the content to grab the users attention. Although there is no tagline, a bright green colour is used to attract the user to important aspects such as the search button or subscribing to the Moshguide newsletter. The design is welcoming the homepage is full of information, inviting the user to read the content. I think this website would attract younger millenials wanting to quickly find information and buy tickets.</p>
                 <p class="body-text fac-competitor-analysis-one-body">Some design decisions I would like to make to the FAC’s website based on this competitor analysis are to use visual elements such as colours, shapes and movement to attract and grab the users attention.

The large buttons and differences in use of text, such as uppercase and lowercase, make the website look unprofessional and disordered. There is lots of content on the front page all fighting for the users attention. However I do feel that these large buttons may attract an older target audience, which is why they may be there. The colour scheme consists of mostly blue which doesn’t allow different elements to stand out. This website is lacking a tagline and call to action button that would draw the viewer into the site. </p>
                <p class="body-text fac-competitor-analysis-one-body">Some design decisions I would like to make to the FAC’s website based on this competitor analysis are to keep the homepage quite simple with limited content. This is so users are not overwhelmed and can click the content they want to view, rather than viewing all of it. I will also make sure to include a tagline and call to action button to draw the user in and establish a focal point. </p>

The chosen theme was labelled as ‘contemporary’ which combined visual elements in a unique and interesting way. A broad range of bright colours were chosen as they hint at Australia’s diverse culture. The geometric font Century gothic was chosen for the purpose of reflecting the historic gothic building and traditions of the Fremantle Arts Centre. The client also liked features from the other visual investigations such as the use of imagery, so some features of each visual investigation were combined to create the desired direction that will help to attract the target demographic.</p>

                    <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">A site map was created to help figure out the different web pages that were going to be present within this website. The main navigational links for this website were kept quite simple with four main links leading from the homepage, some of which had sub-links. Links to external social networking sites were also included to provide users with another way to access information. </p>

                <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">With the basic research completed, content collected and lo-fi sketches of the layout completed, I moved onto wireframes and creating the layouts for the the homepage, news page and events page. These layouts were created using adobe XD, showing how the pages may look of different devices including computers, tablets and mobiles. These wireframes enabled me to focus on the content and create a structure that was easily readable and placed the content in a hierarchal manner. Although only the desktop view is shown, tablet and mobile views were also taken into consideration.  </p>

                <p class="body-text waste-management-colour-body wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">After this, development of the design compositions started to occur which combined both the wireframes and visual investigations and took into account all the initial research into the audience and competitors. The composition of the homepage followed the pattern of having a modern looking section followed by a more traditional looking section to reflect both the contemporary and traditional aspects of the music and venue. The colours explored in the visual investigation were used as a way to highlight call to action buttons and important aspects of information, as the cool blue created contrast with the other warmer colours. The events page and news page followed similar layouts, utilising the same colours and hexagonal shapes to create consistency across the website. During this time, a logo was also created which helped to solidify the brand. This logo can be seen on the top right corner of each of the compositions.</p>

Three participants were tested, their ages ranging from 20-25 all residing within the Perth metropolitan area. The key findings from this usability test were that the design was described as fun, contemporary and eye-catching, the navigational links all worked and lead to the right webpages and that the layout of content was easy to understand. </p>

They clicked on the ‘see all button’ on the home-page which is under the title ‘featured news and events.’  Two participants thought that changes could be made to the layout in the events page. Making both the filters section and the main image smaller, were some suggestions, as they were taking up lots of space, where as the events should be the focus of this page.</p>
